/**
 * How a test set's label-quality verdict is presented.
 *
 * From the UX review: reviewing one document moved a set from "91.7% est. Bronze"
 * to a red "Not rated / Unrated". The *logic* was right — with enough evidence to
 * test whether confidence ranks correctness, the estimator found it does not and
 * withdrew a figure it had been inferring from a cross-set prior. The presentation
 * was not: red reads as a fault the reviewer caused, when in fact the preceding
 * Bronze number was the less honest of the two states.
