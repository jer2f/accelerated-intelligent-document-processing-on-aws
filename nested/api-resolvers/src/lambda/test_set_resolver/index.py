# Two S3 clients, deliberately. They differ only in endpoint, and conflating
# them is what made Test Studio return an opaque 504 in private deployments.
#
# S3_ENDPOINT_URL (set only when S3PresignedUrlViaVpcEndpoint=true or a BYO
# endpoint override is configured) is the *S3 interface VPC endpoint* hostname.
# Its purpose is the URL string handed to the BROWSER: presigning is an offline
# signing operation, so a Lambda can mint a VPCE-hosted URL from anywhere.
#
# Data-plane calls are the opposite. This function is NOT VPC-attached (see the
# cfn_nag/checkov notes on TestSetResolverFunction in the nested template), and
# a VPCE hostname resolves to the endpoint's PRIVATE addresses. Sending LIST /
# GET / PUT there from outside the VPC does not fail — it hangs until the
# connect timeout, and since REST API Gateway abandons an integration at 29s the
# browser only ever sees `504`, with nothing in the resolver log to explain it.
# getTestSets is where this bites first: it lists the whole test-set bucket plus
# ~4 more calls per prefix on every poll.
#
# So: presign with the endpoint, talk to S3 without it. The regular client also
# matches what the rest of the codebase already does from these Lambdas
# (idp_common.s3 builds a plain client), which is why only the calls made
# through this module were affected.

# endpoint or route that cannot be reached, which stalls instead of erroring and

# deployment has no endpoint and no route to misconfigure, so it keeps botocore's
# stock timeouts and this change is a no-op there rather than a new way to fail.
#
# botocore reads max_attempts as a RETRY count, so this is 2 total attempts:
# worst case 2 x (3s connect + 8s read) = 22s for a SINGLE call, plus standard-mode
# backoff sleeps (rand(0,1) x min(2^i, 20)s), which are not in that 22s. This does
# NOT bound the operation: getTestSets lists the bucket and makes ~4 more calls per
# prefix, so a whole-operation bound would have to be a multiple of this. It is a
# per-call guard against an unreachable endpoint stalling indefinitely, not a proof
# the operation fits the 29s budget — that is the dispatcher's read bound
# (_RESOLVER_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS), which returns a labelled 504 regardless of how

    Starting annotation on a set, even one that already has ground truth, commits to a
    new version of it, and the queue link should name that transition.

    The problem underneath is worse than the queue link. A version was
    a **DynamoDB row only** — ``publish_test_set_version`` records a number, a label and
    a file count, and copies nothing. Annotation writes straight to ``{id}/baseline/``.
    So a run stamped ``TestSetVersion = 3`` could not be reproduced against the labels it
    actually scored: the number was immutable, its content was not.

    This makes the transition explicit and preserves what it moves away from:

      * ``baseVersion`` is the state being left. A set that has never been published gets
        its arriving labels published as a version first — the "even if we still have
        ground truth" case, and the common one for an uploaded set.
      * that state is snapshotted to ``{id}/versions/{baseVersion}/baseline/``, so the
        number now refers to bytes.
      * ``draftVersion`` is ``baseVersion + 1``, recorded on the metadata row. The queue
        link carries it, so a link says which transition it belongs to.

    Idempotent: opening a draft that is already open returns it and copies nothing, which
    matters because the annotate view calls this on entry.

    Why an explicit call rather than copy-on-write: the editor saves a baseline through a
    **presigned POST straight from the browser**, so no Lambda observes the write. There
    is no server-side moment to hang a lazy snapshot on — and making the commitment
    visible is what was being asked for anyway.

    offers an opt-in re-extract rather than doing it here.

    ## Sections are renumbered to agree with page order

    Consumers derive a section's group index from its *position in a list*
    (``compute_graded_packet_metrics`` enumerates ``sections_gt``), and nothing
    guarantees that list is in page order. Writing sections as ``1..N`` in first-page
    order makes id order, lexical key order and page order all the same thing, so no
    consumer can disagree about which group a page is in.

    That means rewriting every section file rather than renaming a few. Writes happen
    before deletes, so an interrupted call leaves an extra stale section — visible,
    and recoverable by re-saving — rather than a missing one.

    # Two independent skip-markers have to be invalidated here, because two different

    #
    #  - labelProbedFileCount guards _reconcile_label_state, which is keyed on
    #    fileCount. Clearing drafts deletes baseline objects without changing
    #    membership, so the marker still matches and the set is skipped on every
    #    subsequent list. Observed on a dev stack: a set cleared for a retest kept
    #    reporting "Draft (machine)" and a 97.6% estimated accuracy while every one of
    #    its 100 documents read "Unlabeled", permanently.
    #  - contentSignature (plus the in-process memo) guards the file-listing
    #    reconcile. We just deleted baselines from S3, so the memoized signature no
    #    longer describes the bucket.
    #
    # Dropping the label probe marker is also what makes the ambiguous case correct.
    # With no drafts left the state is knowably "unlabeled"; with some non-draft labels
    # surviving it depends on whether coverage is still complete across documents,
    # which `kept` (a count of label objects) cannot answer. So invalidate the marker
    # and let the reconciler re-derive it through _validate_test_set_files — the same
    # helper registration uses, so the two cannot disagree about what "labeled" means.

    labelState is derived once, when a set is first registered, and afterwards only
    moved by draft-label harvest and reset. Nothing re-derives it when *already
    labelled* documents are added to an existing set — which is exactly what the
    synthetic generator does, writing documents and their baselines straight to S3.
    A set can therefore hold 47 documents of ground truth and still report
    "Unlabeled" with no estimated accuracy, which understates it where the number
    matters most.

    It corrects in both directions. A set can also become *less* labelled than its
    record claims — add documents without baselines to a labelled set and "labeled" is
    simply wrong — and a state that only ever ratchets upward would keep asserting
    ground truth that is no longer complete. (A set promoted in error by an earlier,
    laxer version of this function self-heals for the same reason.)

    Overstating is worse than understating, so the decision is deliberately strict:

    * **Sets owned by a labeling job are never touched.** The harvest writes
      ``draft-machine`` labels under the same ``baseline/`` prefix and only sets
      labelState once it reaches COMPLETED, so a running — or failed — harvest is a
      set with baseline objects that are *not* ground truth. Flipping those to
      "labeled" would put a green badge on unreviewed machine output, start the
      effort estimator on it, and suppress the "Labeling failed" warning.
    * **Coverage must be complete.** Decided by ``_validate_test_set_files``, the
      same helper registration uses, so repair and registration cannot disagree
      about what "labeled" means. One labelled document out of 47 is not a labelled
      set.
    * **Drafts are recorded as drafts.** If the baselines are machine drafts the
      state becomes "draft", never "labeled".

    Converging, too: the fileCount a probe ran against is recorded, so a set is probed
    once per membership change rather than on every read — which is also what makes
    re-checking already-labelled sets affordable, since membership rarely changes.
    Known limitation: baselines added for documents that were *already* in the set (a
    hand-upload straight to S3, rather than a generation that adds documents) leave
    fileCount unchanged and are not re-probed until it changes.
